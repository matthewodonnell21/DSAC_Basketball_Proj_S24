# Clutch Performance Analysis

## Motivation, Data, and Challenges

## Methodology 1

Our first method quantifies the "importance" of each box score statistic using a points-added approach. It relies upon the the leage-wide points per posession for a given season to estimate the impact of clutch actions. If we say the leage-wide points per possession for a given season was **PPP**, we calculate total points added in the clutch as follows...

#### Field Goals Made
**Points Added From 2pt Field Goal Made** = 2 - **PPP**
**Points Added From 3pt Field Goal Made** = 3 - **PPP**
